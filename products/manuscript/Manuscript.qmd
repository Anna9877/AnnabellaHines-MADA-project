# Introduction 

## General Background Information

Many factors can play a part in life expectancy in different countries from availablity of medical care and vaccines to mental health and happiness.

## Description of data and data source
I decided to combine two datasets, one is a life expectancy dataset collected by the World Health organization which I obtained at this link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who from Kaggle. This data specifically looks at immunizations and the human development index for each country along with their life expectancy. The other data set is Worldwide Deaths by country and risk factor which was also downloaded from Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/varpit94/worldwide-deaths-by-risk-factors. This data is as the title states, with the number of deaths for different risk factors in countries by year.
```{r}
#load in each dataset
lifeexp<- read_csv("../../data/raw_data/Life Expectancy Data.csv")
riskfactor<- read_csv("../../data/raw_data/number-of-deaths-by-risk-factor.csv")
#glimpse of each
glimpse(lifeexp)
glimpse(riskfactor)
```
Above shows a quick overview of some of the variables in each dataset. There is a broad range of information that could be investigated for correlations to life expectancy.


## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed
Is there a correlation between certain risk factors and lower life expectancies by country? Have there been any specific trends over the years in which risk factors have become more prevalent?

# Methods 

_Describe your methods. That should describe the data, the cleaning processes, and the analysis approaches. You might want to provide a shorter description here and all the details in the supplement._



## Data import and cleaning

The cleaning of the raw data can be found in datacleaning.qmd file in the code folder and processing_code subfolder. I filtered down the risk factor data set to only include the years from 2000 to 2015 in order to match the life expectancy data. I also renamed variables in each set to make the information clearer or to better match each other.

## Statistical analysis
_Explain anything related to your statistical analyses._

# Results

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis

First, here are summary tables for each dataset to see an overview of the data.

```{r}
#Risk factor dataset summary table
readRDS(summarytable_riskfactor)
```
```{r}
#Life expectancy dataset summary table.
readRDS(summarytable_lifeexp)
```



```{r}
#Plot of Life Expectancy and Adult mortality in 2000
p1_2000
#Plot of Life Expectancy and Adult mortality in 2015
p2_2015
```

_Use a combination of text/tables/figures to explore and describe your data. Show the most important descriptive results here. Additional ones should go in the supplement. Even more can be in the R and Quarto files that are part of your project._


@tbl-summarytable shows a summary of the data.

Note the loading of the data providing a **relative** path using the `../../` notation. (Two dots means a folder up). You never want to specify an **absolute** path like `C:\ahandel\myproject\results\` because if you share this with someone, it won't work for them since they don't have that path. You can also use the `here` R package to create paths. See examples of that below.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-summarytable
#| tbl-cap: "Data summary table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable=readRDS("../../results/summarytable.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable)
```



## Basic statistical analysis

_To get some further insight into your data, if reasonable you could compute simple statistics (e.g. simple models with 1 predictor) to look for associations between your outcome(s) and each individual predictor variable. Though note that unless you pre-specified the outcome and main exposure, any "p<0.05 means statistical significance" interpretation is not valid._


@fig-result shows a scatterplot figure produced by one of the R scripts.

```{r}
#| label: fig-result
#| fig-cap: "Height and weight stratified by gender."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","height_weight_stratified.png"))
```


## Full analysis

_Use one or several suitable statistical/machine learning methods to analyze your data and to produce meaningful figures, tables, etc. This might again be code that is best placed in one or several separate R scripts that need to be well documented. You want the code to produce figures and data ready for display as tables, and save those. Then you load them here._

Example @tbl-resulttable2 shows a summary of a linear model fit.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-resulttable2
#| tbl-cap: "Linear model fit table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable2 = readRDS(here("results","resulttable2.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable2)
```

# Discussion

## Summary and Interpretation
_Summarize what you did, what you found and what it means._

## Strengths and Limitations
_Discuss what you perceive as strengths and limitations of your analysis._

## Conclusions
_What are the main take-home messages?_

_Include citations in your Rmd file using bibtex, the list of references will automatically be placed at the end_

This paper [@leek2015] discusses types of analyses. 

These papers [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a] are good examples of papers published using a fully reproducible setup similar to the one shown in this template. 

Note that this cited reference will show up at the end of the document, the reference formatting is determined by the CSL file specified in the YAML header. Many more style files for almost any journal [are available](https://www.zotero.org/styles). You also specify the location of your bibtex reference file in the YAML. You can call your reference file anything you like, I just used the generic word `references.bib` but giving it a more descriptive name is probably better.
