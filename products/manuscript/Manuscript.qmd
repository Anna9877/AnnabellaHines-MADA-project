# Introduction 

## General Background Information

Many factors can play a part in life expectancy in different countries from availability of medical care and vaccines to mental health and happiness.Factors may differ in the weight of their effect depending on developmental status of the country as well, and some previous research has shown the more obvious variables like GDP or health expenditure may not always be as influential as one may assume in these cases [@Kabir_2008].

## Description of data and data source
I decided to analyze two data sets, one is a life expectancy data set collected by the World Health organization which I obtained at this link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who from Kaggle. This data specifically looks at immunization rates and the human development index for each country along with their overall life expectancy from. The other data set is Worldwide Deaths by country and risk factor which was also downloaded from Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/varpit94/worldwide-deaths-by-risk-factors. This data is as the title states, with the number of deaths for different risk factors in countries by year. Some examples include unsafe water sources and hygiene, child wasting and thinness, lifestyle and behavioral factors, and pollution.

```{r}
#load in each dataset
lifeexp<- read_csv("../../data/raw_data/Life Expectancy Data.csv")
riskfactor<- read_csv("../../data/raw_data/number-of-deaths-by-risk-factor.csv")
#glimpse of each
glimpse(lifeexp)
glimpse(riskfactor)
```
Above shows a quick overview of some of the variables in each dataset. There is a broad range of information that could be investigated for correlations to life expectancy.


## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed
Is there a correlation between certain risk factors and lower life expectancies by country? Have there been any specific trends over the years in which risk factors have become more prevalent?

# Methods 

_Describe your methods. That should describe the data, the cleaning processes, and the analysis approaches. You might want to provide a shorter description here and all the details in the supplement._



## Data import and cleaning

The cleaning of the raw data can be found in datacleaning.qmd file in the code folder and processing_code subfolder. I filtered down the risk factor data set to only include the years from 2000 to 2015 in order to match the life expectancy data. I also renamed variables in each set to make the information clearer or to better match each other.

# Results

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis

First, here are summary tables for each dataset to see an overview of the data.

```{r}
#Risk factor dataset summary table
```
```{r}
#Life expectancy dataset summary table.
```



```{r}
#Plot of Life Expectancy and Adult mortality in 2000
#| label: fig-exp1
#| fig-cap: "Life Expectancy and Adult Mortality 2000"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","p1_2000.png"))
#Plot of Life Expectancy and Adult mortality in 2015
#| label: fig-exp2
#| fig-cap: "Life Expectancy and Adult Mortality 2015"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","p2_2015.png"))
```


```{r}
#| label: fig-result3
#| fig-cap: "Life Expectancy Status Boxplot."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","LifeExpectancyStatusBoxPlot.png"))
```




## Basic statistical analysis

_To get some further insight into your data, if reasonable you could compute simple statistics (e.g. simple models with 1 predictor) to look for associations between your outcome(s) and each individual predictor variable. Though note that unless you pre-specified the outcome and main exposure, any "p<0.05 means statistical significance" interpretation is not valid._

## Full analysis

_Use one or several suitable statistical/machine learning methods to analyze your data and to produce meaningful figures, tables, etc. This might again be code that is best placed in one or several separate R scripts that need to be well documented. You want the code to produce figures and data ready for display as tables, and save those. Then you load them here._
