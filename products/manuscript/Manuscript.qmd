# Abstract
Life expectancy is an important general metric in comparing countries health of their populations on the same scale, but the factors that lead affect it and numerous and nuanced.The goal is to create a model to better understand which risks are the most influential on life expectancy by combining two data sets containing information on life expectancy, demographics, and prevalent risk factors. Through analysis of data collected by the World Health Organization on the average life expectancy and most prevalent risk factors for death for each country over the years, I aim to draw initial associations that may be areas for further study or targets of public health measures. Through a surface level exploration of the data, the trends in life expectancy compared to other factors can be observed and then further examined with simple statistical analyses. After that point, machine learning models are employed to more accurately predict life expectancy from provided variables.

# Introduction 

## General Background Information

With new unique risks arising to human health, along with older ones becoming less prevalent, the factors that tie in to life expectancy are changing over time. Broad vaccine coverage has virtually eliminated the presence of diseases like polio and measles in most developed countries and populations, while air pollution and poor nutrition/weight issues have become an increasing problem for many people[@Goodson_2017] [@Yin_2020]. The risk exposures that have increased the most globally from 2010 to 2019 are ambient particulate matter pollution, drug use, high fasting plasma glucose, and high body-mass index while the ones that have decreased are household air pollution, unsafe water, sanitation and handwashing, child growth failure, tobacco smoking, and lead exposure [@Murray_2020]. Although the leading risk factors resulting in death vary by age and location, the overall highest were high systolic blood pressure and and tobacco [@Murray_2020].

Many factors can play a part in life expectancy in different countries from availability of medical care and vaccines to mental health and happiness.Factors may differ in the weight of their effect depending on developmental status of the country as well, and some previous research has shown the more obvious variables like GDP or health expenditure may not always be as influential as one may assume in these cases [@Kabir_2008]. There have been attempts to create formulas to mathematically determine a population's life expectancy based on risk factors within that population but each are so specific that its difficult to create an overall generalizable model.
--Will be adding more soon--

## Description of data and data source
I decided to analyze two data sets, one is a life expectancy data set collected by the World Health organization which I obtained at this link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who from Kaggle. This data specifically looks at immunization rates and the human development index for each country along with their overall life expectancy from. The other data set is Worldwide Deaths by country and risk factor which was also downloaded from Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/varpit94/worldwide-deaths-by-risk-factors. This data is as the title states, with the number of deaths for different risk factors in countries by year. Some examples include unsafe water sources and hygiene, child wasting and thinness, lifestyle and behavioral factors, and pollution. The summary table of the risk factor data set [@table-1] and life expectancy data set [@table-2] can be seen in the exploratory and descriptive analysis section of the manuscript.

```{r}
readRDS(file = "../../results/glimpserisk.rds")
readRDS(file="../../results/glimpselife.rds")
```
Above shows a quick overview of some of the variables in each data set. There is a broad range of information that could be investigated for correlations to life expectancy.


## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed
Which variables are the most highly correlated to life expectancy? Are there differences in the most associated factors between the years 2000 and 2015?

# Methods 

The data for each set was separated by country and year, with the metrics represented in either percentages or number per 100,000 people. The full explanation of each variable can be found in the supplementary material. Cleaning the data involved matching the years of both data sets and combining them, along with renaming certain variables for more clarification. The analysis starts with some simple one variable linear models focused on the association to the variable of interest, life expectancy. Then a few machine learning approaches were used, including the decision tree model.


## Data import and cleaning

The cleaning of the raw data can be found in datacleaning.qmd file in the code folder and processing_code subfolder. I filtered down the risk factor data set to only include the years from 2000 to 2015 in order to match the life expectancy data. I also renamed variables in each set to make the information clearer and more ubiquitous, such as 'Entity' to 'Country' in the risk factor data.

## Statistical analysis
Initially some generalized linear models were ran with all variables and with certain subsets of variables. Life expectancy is negatively correlated with the status of developing and positively correlated with the status of developed. After finding those results, some machine learning methods were used for more specialized conclusions and predictive modeling. A decision tree @fig-result5 was developed initially that illustrated simple predictive variables leading to the strata of life expectancy.

# Results

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis

First, here are summary tables for each data set to see an overview of the data.

```{r}
#Risk factor dataset summary table
#| label: table-1
#| fig-cap: "Risk Factor Data Summary Tabel"
#| echo: FALSE
readRDS(file = "../../results/summarytableriskfactor.rds")
```
```{r}
#| label: table-2
#| fig-cap: "Life Expectancy Data Summary Table"
#| echo: FALSE
readRDS("../../results/summarytablelifeexp.rds")
```



```{r}
#Plot of Life Expectancy and Adult mortality in 2000
#| label: fig-exp1
#| fig-cap: "Life Expectancy and Adult Mortality 2000"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","p1_2000.png"))
#Plot of Life Expectancy and Adult mortality in 2015
#| label: fig-exp2
#| fig-cap: "Life Expectancy and Adult Mortality 2015"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","p2_2015.png"))
```


```{r}
#| label: fig-result3
#| fig-cap: "Life Expectancy Status Boxplot in 2000 and 2015."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","LifeExpectancyStatusBoxPlotFull.png"))
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-result4
#| fig-cap: "Deaths Due to Unsafe Water Source, Unsafe Sanitation, or No Access to Handwashing Facilities in the United States from 2000 to 2015"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","WaterriskUS.png"))
```



## Basic statistical analysis

Here I explored some factors that would seem to be reasonably significant with simple single predictor models to life expectancy, the outcome of interest. 

First, a logistic regression with country status and life expectancy.
```{r}
#| label: glm-result1
#| fig-cap: "Logistic regression with Life Expectancy against Development Status"
#| echo: FALSE
readRDS(file="../../results/tidyglm1.rds")
```
Life expectancy is negatively correlated with the country status of `developing`.

Then a linear regression comparing year to life expectancy.
```{r}
#| label: lm-1
#| fig-cap: "Linear Regression Results of Year vs. Life Expectancy"
#| echo: FALSE
readRDS(file="../../results/tidyfitlm1.rds")
```
Year is positively correlated with life expectancy.

Another linear regression with BMI.
```{r}
#| label: lm-2
#| fig-cap: "Linear Regression Results of BMI vs. Life Expectancy"
#| echo: FALSE
readRDS("../../results/tidyfitlm2.rds")
```
In this instance, BMI is positively correlated with life expectancy.

```{r}
#| label: lm-3
#| fig-cap: "Linear Regression Results of Polio Vaccination Rates vs. Life Expectancy"
#| echo: FALSE
readRDS("../../results/tidyfitlm3.rds")
```
Polio doesn't seem significantly correlated.

```{r}
#| label: lm-4
#| fig-cap: "Linear Regression Results of Measles Cases vs. Life Expectancy"
#| echo: FALSE
readRDS("../../results/tidyfitlm4.rds")
```
Measles does not seem significantly correlated with life expectancy.

```{r}
#| label: lm-5
#| fig-cap: "Linear Regression Results of Air Pollution vs. Life Expectancy"
#| echo: FALSE
readRDS("../../results/tidyfitlm5.rds")
```
Air pollution is negatively correlated with life expectancy.

```{r}
#| label: lm-6
#| fig-cap: "Linear Regression Results of Low Physical Activity vs. Life Expectancy"
#| echo: FALSE
readRDS("../../results/tidyfitlm6.rds")
```


## Full analysis


Here is a decision tree model with the predictions for different stratum of life expectancy.
```{r}
#Decision Tree Graphic
#| label: fig-result5
#| fig-cap: "Decision tree"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","tree.png"))
```
The initial split was on unsafe sanitation, with the split reported as yes further split with HIV and AIDS into the lower life expectancy strata. If there is no unsafe sanitation, it further is split into income composition of resources and then adult mortality. This a simpler and less nuanced model but has an overall look at the predictive value of the data.

# Discussion

## Summary and Interpretation
_Summarize what you did, what you found and what it means._

## Strengths and Limitations
Some strengths include how large and expansive the data set is, as it has many variables for nearly every country and with a large range of years. A weakness that goes along with that is that it was difficult to work with such a large data set and pick out what the most important things to explore were. Also life expectancy is a nuanced estimate that has to do with a combination of multiple factors and also things that are not included in the available data, so a truly accurate analysis may be out of my reach.

## Conclusions
_What are the main take-home messages?_
