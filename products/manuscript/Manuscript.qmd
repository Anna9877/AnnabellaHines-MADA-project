# Abstract
Life expectancy is an important general metric in comparing countries' health of their populations on the same scale, but the factors that affect it are numerous and nuanced.The goal is to create a model to better understand which risks are the most influential on life expectancy by combining two data sets containing information on life expectancy, demographics, and prevalent risk factors. Through analysis of data collected by the World Health Organization on the average life expectancy and most prevalent risk factors for death for each country over the years, I aim to draw initial associations that may be areas for further study or targets of public health measures. Through a surface level exploration of the data, the trends in life expectancy compared to other factors can be observed and then further examined with simple statistical analyses. After that point, machine learning models are employed to more accurately predict life expectancy from provided variables.

# Introduction 

## General Background Information

With new unique risks arising to human health, along with older ones becoming less prevalent, the factors that tie in to life expectancy are changing over time. Broad vaccine coverage has virtually eliminated the presence of diseases like polio and measles in most developed countries and populations, while air pollution and poor nutrition/weight issues have become an increasing problem for many people[@Goodson_2017] [@Yin_2020]. The risk exposures that have increased the most globally from 2010 to 2019 are ambient particulate matter pollution, drug use, high fasting plasma glucose, and high body-mass index while the ones that have decreased are household air pollution, unsafe water/sanitation/handwashing, child growth failure, tobacco smoking, and lead exposure [@Murray_2020]. Although the leading risk factors resulting in death vary by age and location, the overall highest were high systolic blood pressure and and tobacco use[@Murray_2020].

Many factors can play a part in life expectancy in different countries from availability of medical care and vaccines to mental health and happiness. Factors may differ in the weight of their effect depending on developmental status of the country as well, and some previous research has shown the more obvious variables like GDP or health expenditure may not always be as influential as one may assume in these cases [@Kabir_2008]. There have been attempts to create formulas to mathematically determine a population's life expectancy based on risk factors within that population but each are so specific that its difficult to create an overall generalizable model.

## Description of data and data source
I decided to analyze two data sets, one is a life expectancy data set collected by the World Health organization which I obtained at this link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who from Kaggle. This data specifically looks at immunization rates and the human development index for each country along with their overall life expectancy from. The other data set is Worldwide Deaths by country and risk factor which was also downloaded from Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/varpit94/worldwide-deaths-by-risk-factors. This data is as the title states, with the number of deaths for different risk factors in countries by year. Some examples include unsafe water sources and hygiene, child wasting and thinness, lifestyle and behavioral factors, and pollution. The summary table of the risk factor data set [@table-1] and life expectancy data set [@table-2] can be seen in the exploratory and descriptive analysis section of the manuscript.


## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed
Which variables are the most highly correlated to life expectancy? What risk factors or demographics are the best predictors of life expectancy? Are there differences in the most associated factors between the years 2000 and 2015?



# Methods 

The data for each set was separated by country and year, with the metrics represented in either percentages or number per 100,000 people. The full explanation of each variable can be found in the supplementary material. Cleaning the data involved matching the years of both data sets and combining them, along with renaming certain variables for more clarification. The analysis starts with some simple one variable linear models focused on the association to the variable of interest, life expectancy. Then a machine learning approaches was used, specifically the decision tree model.


## Data import and cleaning

The cleaning of the raw data can be found in datacleaning.qmd file in the code folder and processing_code subfolder. I filtered down the risk factor data set to only include the years from 2000 to 2015 in order to match the life expectancy data. I also renamed variables in each set to make the information clearer and more ubiquitous, such as 'Entity' to 'Country' in the risk factor data.

## Statistical analysis
Initially some generalized linear models were ran with specific variables that would seem the relevant logically. After finding those results, a machine learning method, a decision tree, was used for more specialized conclusions and predictive modeling. The decision tree [@fig-result5] was developed initially that illustrated simple predictive variables leading to the strata of life expectancy. A multivariate linear regression was ran with all of the variables to determine which were the most significant, than that subset of variables was run again on their own.

# Results

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis

First, here are summary tables for each data set to see an overview of the data.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#| label: table-1
#| fig-cap: "Risk Factor Data Summary Tabel"
#| echo: FALSE
readRDS(file = "../../results/summarytableriskfactor.rds")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#| label: table-2
#| fig-cap: "Life Expectancy Data Summary Table"
#| echo: FALSE
readRDS("../../results/summarytablelifeexp.rds")
```



```{r}
#| label: fig-exp1
#| fig-cap: "Life Expectancy and Adult Mortality 2000"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","p1_2000.png"))
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-exp2
#| fig-cap: "Life Expectancy and Adult Mortality 2015"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","p2_2015.png"))
```


The trend of life expectancy decreasing as adult mortality increases is similar in 2000 and 2015, with developed countries shown at the end with high life expectancy and low adult mortality.

```{r}
#| label: fig-result3
#| fig-cap: "Life Expectancy Status Boxplot in 2000 and 2015."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","LifeExpectancyStatusBoxPlotFull.png"))
```
The life expectancy distribution for developed and developing countries were similar in 2000 and 2015, with developed countries having an overall higher distribution.


## Basic statistical analysis

Here I explored some factors that would seem to be reasonably significant with simple single predictor models to life expectancy, the outcome of interest. 

First, a logistic regression with country status and life expectancy.
```{r}
#| label: glm-result1
#| fig-cap: "Logistic regression with Life Expectancy against Development Status"
#| echo: FALSE
readRDS(file="../../results/tidyglm1.rds")
```
Life expectancy appears to be negatively correlated with the country status of `developing`.

Then a linear regression comparing year to life expectancy.
```{r}
#| label: lm-1
#| fig-cap: "Linear Regression Results of Year vs. Life Expectancy"
#| echo: FALSE
readRDS(file="../../results/tidyfitlm1.rds")
```
Year is positively correlated with life expectancy.

Another linear regression with BMI.
```{r}
#| label: lm-2
#| fig-cap: "Linear Regression Results of BMI vs. Life Expectancy"
#| echo: FALSE
readRDS("../../results/tidyfitlm2.rds")
```
In this instance, BMI is positively correlated with life expectancy.

```{r}
#| label: lm-3
#| fig-cap: "Linear Regression Results of Polio Vaccination Rates vs. Life Expectancy"
#| echo: FALSE
readRDS("../../results/tidyfitlm3.rds")
```
Polio doesn't seem significantly correlated.

```{r}
#| label: lm-4
#| fig-cap: "Linear Regression Results of HIV/AIDS Cases vs. Life Expectancy"
#| echo: FALSE
readRDS("../../results/tidyfitlm4.rds")
```
Deaths from HIV/AIDS is negatively correlated with life expectancy.

```{r}
#| label: lm-5
#| fig-cap: "Linear Regression Results of Air Pollution vs. Life Expectancy"
#| echo: FALSE
readRDS("../../results/tidyfitlm5.rds")
```
Air pollution is negatively correlated with life expectancy.

```{r}
#| label: lm-6
#| fig-cap: "Linear Regression Results of Low Physical Activity vs. Life Expectancy"
#| echo: FALSE
readRDS("../../results/tidyfitlm6.rds")
```


## Full analysis


Here is a decision tree model with the predictions for different stratum of life expectancy.
```{r}
#| label: fig-result5
#| fig-cap: "Decision Tree"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","treeall.png"))
```
The initial split was on high numbers of HIV and AIDS,then polio into the lower life expectancy strata. If there are low numbers of HIV and AIDS, it further is split into income composition of resources and then adult mortality and child stunting. This a simpler and less nuanced model but has an overall look at the predictive value of the data. 

Out of curiosity, here is also a decision tree for only the data from the year 2015, which had a different configuration with the addition of polio and child stunting but the overall most influential variables were HIV/AIDS, income composition of resources, and adult mortality.
```{r}
#| label: fig-result6
#| fig-cap: "Decision tree 2015"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","tree2015.png"))
```


Next, a multivariate regression analysis was performed with all of the variables to determine which were the most significant in predicting life expectancy.
```{r}
#| label: fullmodel
#| fig-cap: "Multivariate Linear Regression with all variables"
#| echo: FALSE
readRDS("../../results/summaryfullmodel.rds")
```

The variables marked as significant when all of them are included in predicting life expectancy are year, adult mortality, under five deaths, total expenditure, HIV/AIDS, income composition of resources, years of education, low birth weight for gestation, drug use, and high body mass index. The ones that were the most significant of those are adult mortality, total expenditure, HIV/AIDS, income composition of resources, and years of education.
Here is a regression run with those variables deemed significant by the previous model.

```{r}
#| label: model2
#| fig-cap: "Multivariate Linear Regression with most significant variables"
#| echo: FALSE
readRDS("../../results/summarymodel2.rds")
```

# Discussion

## Summary and Interpretation
After cleaning the data and combining the sets, the variables were explored to get an estimate of possible associations to look into further. Status of developing or developed appeared highly correlated with life expectancy, along with infant deaths and year. After getting an overall idea of what the data looked like and loose associations, statistical tests were ran to get a more concrete idea of the actual association. These tests and models provided output on what variables had the closest relevance and association to the provided life expectancy.They didn't contradict the initial visual associations but revealed more significant correlations such as income composition of resources and adult mortality. It makes logical sense that adult mortality would be tightly associated with life expectancy as it is the rate of adult deaths. Income composition is an interesting variable, as it is described as a version of human development index, which is a kind of quantification of development status. This makes sense with how the status variable itself was correlated highly as well. The other factor deemed significant by both the multivariate regression and the decision tree was the number of deaths per 1,000 live births due to HIV/AIDS for children 0-4 years of age. This is reasonable as it indicates the level of HIV or AIDS in the total population as the most common mode that children contract HIV is through the mother. It illustrates deaths in one of the most vulnerable parts of the population and indicates that it may be in a community without resources for infant prophylaxis, possibly a lower income or developing country [@Levy_1993].

## Strengths and Limitations
Some strengths include how large and expansive the data set is, as it has many variables for nearly every country and with a large range of years. It also comes from a very reliable source, the World Health Organization. A weakness that goes along with that is that it was difficult to work with such a large data set and pick out what the most important things to explore were. Also life expectancy is a nuanced estimate that has to do with a combination of multiple factors and also things that are not included in the available data, so a truly accurate analysis may be out of my reach. There was also a fair amount of missing data for some variables, also making it hard to have a fully formed analysis.

## Conclusions
Both full statistical analyses were in general agreement of adult mortality, income composition of resources, and HIV/AIDS being the most predictive of life expectancy. These could be factors to explore more in the future for more concrete correlations and associations and possibly eventually the targets for improving life expectancy in various parts of the world. The purpose of these results is to be purely exploratory and it has answered the original questions.
